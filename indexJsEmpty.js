/*Step 1
You will be building a shopping cart application. The HTML and CSS are already provided, but you will need to build the JavaScript to make the page interactive.

To start, you will need to get some of your elements from the DOM. 
Start by using document.getElementById() to get 
the#cart-container, 
#products-container,
and #dessert-card-container elements.

Store them in variables named 
cartContainer,
productsContainer,
and dessertCards, respectively.

Since these will not change, remember to use const to declare them.*/
